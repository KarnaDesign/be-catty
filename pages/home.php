<div class="pageFormat">
    <h2>Welcome to Be Catty</h2>
    <p>Next on my list of demos to make is a Single Page Application. I've made it about cats,
        simply because they are adorable and because they do rule the world (well, at least the internet...).</p>
    <p>In this first version I decided on a total of five different pages, each presenting a type of cat.</p>
    <p>I wanted to make a SPA partly because it was a natural step for me and partly to get more into Ajax. SPA is
    very handy since the page never need to reload, no matter how many individual pages it consists of. It simply uses Ajax to load the new content.</p>
    <p>This is the first version. For the next one I plan to:

    <ul>
        <li>Make the browsers back and forward buttons work.</li>
        <li>Make Google read the content of my pages.</li>
        <li>This version only fetches HTML-data. For my next trick, I want to fetch JSON-data.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
