    <h2>SIAMESE</h2>
    <p>The Siamese cat is one of the first distinctly recognized breeds of Oriental cat. One of several breeds native to
        Thailand (formerly known as Siam), the Siamese cat became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North
        America in the 20th century.</p>
    <p>The modern Siamese is characterized by blue almond-shaped eyes, a triangular head shape, large ears, an
        elongated, slender, and muscular body, and point coloration. TICA describes the breed as social, intelligent,
        and playful into adulthood, often enjoying a game of fetch. Siamese tend to seek human interaction and also like
        companionship from other cats.</p>
    <p>The Oriental cat was developed in order to expand the
        range of coat patterns, while the Thai preserves a moderate head and body type.</p>
